When presented with multiple programs solving the same problem, there are
generally two goals: rank the programs, and diagnose each program's faults.

Based on the work of Claessen et. al., we present several improved methods
for objectively ranking programs through black box testing. Our methods
improve the descriptive power of tests without changing the testing
infrastructure. Additionally, our methods are capable of analyzing
potentially incomplete batch testing data, allowing for faster testing
infrastructures.

We also use the knowledge from black-box test results to diagnose the
faults in a program. Naive diagnostics currently in use present an
unfiltered list of the tests a program failed. Existing improvements
present only the failures necessary to create a ranking, limiting the size
of this list. We leverage relationships between tests to create a smaller,
less noisy set of tests to present as a diagnosis of a program's faults.
