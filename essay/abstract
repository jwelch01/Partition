We present algorithms for analyzing multiple programs that solve the
same problem.  The algorithms help an analyst rank the programs and
diagnose each program's faults.

We rank programs objectively by analyzing the results of black-box
testing.  Our analysis encompasses a richer notion of "result" than
that used in prior work.  And our method can analyze incomplete
results, which enables us to run more tests faster by batching tests.

We also use black-box test results to help diagnose a program's
faults.  Naive diagnostics list all tests a program failed.  Prior
work presents only the failures necessary to rank programs---a shorter
list.  By discovering relationships between tests, our algorithm
presents an even shorter, less noisy diagnostic list.
