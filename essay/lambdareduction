Test nr403 made redundant by nr97
nr97's witness:
Term "\a.M_eta a" should normalize to "M_eta", but your interpreter reduced it 
to "\a.M_eta a", which has an eta-redex "\a.M_eta a".

nr403's witness:
Term "(\x.\x.\a.M_eta a) y" should normalize to "\x.M_eta", but your interpreter reduced it 
to "\x.\x.\a.M_eta a", which has an eta-redex "\a.M_eta a".
