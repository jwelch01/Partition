A collection of files from comp 40 and comp 105 with 'outcomes' in the name.
Any file that has -o or -oo in the name is probably and 'old' outcome
and might be suspect.

For the 105 stuff there is a significant amount of code available for
computing sizes of tests and for visualizing tests and graph edges.  
For the 40 stuff there is almost nothing.
