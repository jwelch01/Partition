mapFold doesn't actually work. Needs to build up a key list as I go,
then check if I've hit the sentinel, and call f if and only if I am at the
sentinel, with the key list not including the sentinel as the key and the 
value as the value, using the results from f as the y value.

make sure the getting leaves in each path won't overwrite the y value
from any other path.
