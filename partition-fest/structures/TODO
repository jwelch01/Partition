structure names to begin with capital latters

break up basis.sml into at least three pieces:

  - reading outcomes file (boring)
  - writing dot file (also boring)
  - the interesting stuff

For each function in the interesting stuff, put an explicit signature
in the definition of the Basis structure.

Better dot output (commas, newlines)  ||....|.|

Find a meaningful way to order tests into a test vector (instead of
arbitrary as now).

Print out, in human-readable form, what we have learned about
contingency (from a set of outcomes).
