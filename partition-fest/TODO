Better dot output (commas, newlines)  ||....|.|

Find a meaningful way to order tests into a test vector (instead of
arbitrary as now).


----------------------------------------------------------------

Print out, in human-readable form, what we have learned about
contingency (from a set of outcomes).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Insure that program is agnostic to outcome type in all areas, except 
where knowledge is strictly necessary

Start creating implications.
-create a set of every test and its outcome datatype = (test * outcome)
-create its inverse
-append them and name it literals
-double fold across literals, testing if, for each pair of literals,
 p->q, and adding them to a list of implications if true
-turn this implication list into a graph
-make the graph dot output, tred it, and see what happens
